# Hello World

This is simply testing my knowledge on how to setup React and go back to the basics.
Nothing Special.

The quick link of testing Hello World can be found here:

# How to see if it works

1. Clone the Repo so you can run it locally
```
git clone https://github.com/thatdania/HelloWorld-.git
```

2. Change into the project directory

```
cd helloworld
```

3. Npm install to make sure you got all the dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Run Npm start and you should be able to see hello world on the screen
```
npm start 
```
